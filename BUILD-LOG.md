# ilmi — build log

One entry per session, newest first. `PLAN.md` holds the milestone list and
the per-milestone notes; this file holds the narrative: what was done, what
was verified, what was not, and the prompt to resume with.

## 2026-09-22 — milestone 4: tree, sidebar, lenses

Commit `80648ae` — *tree: sidebar, tree operations over disk, panes and lenses*.

### Done

- `src/vault/paths.ts`: vault-relative path arithmetic (`dirOf`, `nameOf`,
  `childDirOf`, `rekey`, `within`, `cleanName`).
- `Vault` gained `createFolder`, `createDoc`, `rename`, `move`, `remove`.
  Each waits for pending watcher work, goes to disk through `Fs`, re-keys
  the cache, re-walks, and emits `tree`; rename and move emit a new
  `moved { from, to }` event, delete emits `gone` per cached document. A
  document's `name/` directory travels with it. Renaming an extract
  rewrites its parent's `<!-- extract -->` backrefs through `update`, one
  line each. Names are taken when `name` or `name.md` exists, so a
  document never adopts a stray folder as children and a folder never
  becomes a document's children by accident. `NEW_NAMES` holds the default
  names; free names get ` 2`, ` 3`. New drafts get `started` and
  `write: due=<today> ivl=1 reps=0`. `VaultState.sidebar` added.
- `src/app/panes.ts`: the prototype's pane and tab model as pure functions
  (`openTab` with ⌘ / ⌘⇧ semantics, `closeTab`, `splitPane` up to three,
  `closePane`, `retarget` after a move, `dropTabs` after a delete). A tab
  is just a path; kind and title come from the store at render time.
- `src/app/store.ts`: `tree`, `docs` (a `DocInfo` per document: type,
  title, frozen, card and due counts, read and write schedules), `open`,
  `sidebar`, `panes`. `src/app/vault.ts` mirrors vault events into it,
  persists `folders` / `tab` / `sidebar` to `.ilmi/state.json` with a
  300 ms debounce (open state is pruned against the tree on every `tree`
  event, so a deleted folder does not linger in `folders`), and wraps the
  ops (`createNode`, `renameNode` also updates `title` when the document
  has one, `moveNode`, `removeNode`).
- `Tree.tsx`: the sidebar tree after `tree.jsx`: chevrons, per-type glyph
  and colour, count or state in the margin (`3 cards · 1 due`, `done`,
  `due`), click opens, chevron folds, double-click or F2 renames inline,
  drag moves beside a row or into a folder, right-click menu with new
  source / folder / deck / draft, rename, move to… (every folder but the
  node's own subtree and current parent), delete. `Canvas.tsx`: panes and
  tab bars (⊟ splits, × closes, middle-click closes a tab). `Lenses.tsx`:
  folder and deck lenses as lists with the prototype's `+ source` row and
  card rows; source / extract / draft render as a read-only page until
  milestone 5. `names.ts` and `useDoc.ts` are the shared helpers.
- `App.tsx`: sidebar with drag-resize handle (drag under 80 px hides it,
  drag out again shows it), ⌘⇧E toggles, ⌘W closes a tab, ⌘\ splits.
- Tauri: `allow_vault` now also grants `vault/.ilmi` by name, because the
  fs plugin's global scope matches with `require_literal_leading_dot` on
  unix whatever the config says, so `vault/**` never reached `.ilmi/` and
  `loadState` threw on the first launch. A macOS menu without Close
  Window, so ⌘W reaches the webview. `initial_vault` became `dev_env`;
  `ILMI_SMOKE=1` runs `src/app/smoke.ts`, which drives every tree op
  through the real adapter and logs each result.
- Tests: 21 in `src/vault/__tests__/tree.test.ts` (path helpers, create
  with numbering and inside a document, draft and deck front-matter,
  rename with children and cache re-keying, extract rename fixing the
  parent's backref by one line, folder rename, refusals, move with
  children, into a document, refusals, delete with `gone` events, no
  double `tree` event from the watcher echo, sidebar state) and 6 in
  `src/app/__tests__/panes.test.ts`.

### Verified

- `npm test` green (152 tests), `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build`
  ok, `cargo check` ok.
- Done-when, in vitest over the temp corpus: renaming `wozniak-1990` moves
  `papers/wozniak-1990.md` and `papers/wozniak-1990/` together, the tree
  and the cache follow, and the `moved` event carries both paths; renaming
  `woz-ex1` changes exactly one line of the parent (`<!-- extract
  woz-first -->`); folder rename, move with children, move into a
  document's children directory, delete of a document with children, and
  every refusal (own subtree, taken name, missing target, bad name) are
  covered.
- Done-when, in the window: `ILMI_VAULT=<scratch copy> ILMI_SMOKE=1 npm run
  tauri dev` logged, through plugin-fs: `folder untitled folder`, `deck
  untitled folder/untitled deck.md`, `renamed untitled folder/smoke
  deck.md`, `moved papers/smoke deck.md`, `moved with children untitled
  folder/wozniak-1990.md → untitled folder/wozniak-1990.md, untitled
  folder/wozniak-1990/woz-ex1.md`, `moved back papers/wozniak-1990.md`,
  `renamed extract papers/wozniak-1990/woz-first.md; parent has backref:
  true`, `removed; tree unchanged: true`, `state: {"folders":["","papers"]}`.
  So the Tauri adapter renames across directories, removes non-empty
  directories, and writes `.ilmi/state.json`, which was the open question
  from milestone 2.

### Not verified

- The window itself was not seen: no screenshot path in this sandbox and
  the Chrome extension does not reach a Tauri webview. Layout and CSS are
  by reading; the tree, tabs, menus, drag, and rename were not clicked.
- The keyboard bindings and the macOS menu change in the window.
- `Fs.watch` events for our own rename arriving through plugin-fs; in
  vitest they do not produce a second `tree` event.

### Decisions worth knowing

- Delete is immediate and permanent, as in the prototype: no confirm, no
  trash. Worth revisiting once there is an undo or a trash in the plan.
- Rename edits the file name; a document with a `title` field gets the
  same text as its title, so what the row shows and what you typed agree.
- The tree shows folders and documents only. The prototype's card leaves
  under sources and decks were left out (the milestone lists documents).
- Saved queries, queue tabs, the top and bottom strips, and the inspector
  wait for milestones 8 and 9; the shell grid is two columns for now.
- `Panes.tsx` cannot live beside `panes.ts` on a case-insensitive disk
  (tsc TS1149), hence `Canvas.tsx`.
- `openInitialVault` runs once even though StrictMode mounts the effect
  twice; two concurrent opens ran the smoke script twice and the runs
  collided on names.

### Handoff prompt

Paste into a fresh session:

```
Read PLAN.md, FORMAT.md, BUILD-LOG.md, and spec/hashiyah/HANDOFF.md.

Context: milestones 0-4 are done. src/format/ parses and serializes vault
files (parse / serialize / meta / setField; never string-edit a file).
src/vault/ opens, walks, reads, writes, watches, and reshapes a vault over
an Fs interface; change a file with vault.update(path, mutate); tree ops
are vault.createFolder / createDoc / rename / move / remove. src/schedule/
grades cards with ts-fsrs, runs the reading and writing loops, and builds
the queue. src/app/ has the sidebar tree, panes and tabs (a tab is a
path), and list lenses; DocLens in src/app/Lenses.tsx is a read-only
placeholder for the reader. Tests run in vitest over a temp copy of
src/format/__tests__/corpus/vault. ILMI_VAULT=/path npm run tauri dev
opens a vault at launch; add ILMI_SMOKE=1 to exercise the tree ops through
Tauri and log results.

Tooling: node is in /opt/homebrew/bin and cargo in ~/.cargo/bin; neither is
on the tool-shell PATH. Prefix every command with
export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
npm test and npm run typecheck must be green before a commit.

Do milestone 5 in PLAN.md (reader: the unified document editor) and only
that one. ProseMirror over Doc.blocks, edits written back through
vault.update and serialize, KaTeX for math, frozen sources lock prose, the
left-margin read marker writes read.pos. Follow spec/hashiyah/reader.jsx
for behavior and the brief's copy rules for every string. Stop at the
milestone's "done when". Then tick it in PLAN.md, write notes for the next
session under it, add an entry to BUILD-LOG.md with a fresh handoff prompt,
and commit.
```

## 2026-09-21 — milestone 3: scheduler

Commit `b5505bb` — *schedule: ts-fsrs grading, reading and writing loops, queue query*.

### Done

- `ts-fsrs` 5.4 added. `src/schedule/card.ts`: `toFsrs` / `fromFsrs` map a
  `CardSchedule` onto a ts-fsrs `Card` per FORMAT.md §6.2; `grade` and
  `preview` wrap `fsrs().next` / `.repeat` with default parameters (fuzz
  off, learning steps on). Output rounded to two decimals; `last` is set to
  `now` as a UTC instant; `due` is a day when `ivl` ≥ 1, else an instant.
- `read.ts` and `write.ts`: the reading loop (`readOn`, `postpone`, done
  drops `read`) and the writing loop (`workedOn`, `postpone`, `done` keeps
  the line), plus `advanceRead` / `advanceWrite` over a `Doc`.
- `queue.ts`: `docItems` / `queueItems` / `queue(vault, now, scope)`,
  `counts`, `cardGroups`, `gradeItem` (id assignment, blank numbering, one
  line rewritten), `numberBlank`, `newId`.
- `dates.ts`: local-day arithmetic, UTC instants, `daysBetween` by UTC date.
- 30 tests in `src/schedule/__tests__/schedule.test.ts`: date arithmetic,
  the ts-fsrs mapping both ways, grading new / review / relearning cards,
  determinism and unknown-attribute survival, both loops through the
  document, cloze group keys and numbering, and over a temp copy of the
  corpus: the counts for 2026-05-27, multi-blank expansion, fallback to the
  bare line, sort order, reading progress, one-line diff on grade, one-line
  diff on grading one blank of a multi-blank card, numbering an unnumbered
  blank (text line + one new `sr c1` line), id assignment for an
  unscheduled card, id collision avoidance, and locating a card by id after
  the file shifted.

### Verified

- `npm test` green (125 tests), `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build`
  ok.
- Done-when 1: grading `cw1-paths` good on 2026-05-27 through `vault.update`
  changes line 15 of `papers/wozniak-1990.md` and nothing else; the line is
  `<!-- sr due=2026-07-11 st=review s=44.92 d=3.79 r=10 l=0 ivl=45
  last=2026-05-27T12:00:00Z g=3 -->`.
- Done-when 2: the queue for 2026-05-27 over the corpus is today 17 (13
  cards, 3 reading, 1 writing), upcoming 13, cards 24, reading 4, writing 2.
  The prototype's `data.jsx` gives today 16 (11 / 4 / 1) and upcoming 14.
  The gap is entirely in the data, not the rules, and each difference was
  checked by hand: the corpus numbers `cw2-min` as c1/c2 with c2 due
  2026-06-01 (prototype: two lone blanks, both due), adds `cd-resurface`
  (two new groups, due), adds the unscheduled `ein Wort ohne Karte` (new,
  due), lacks `atomic-notes.md` (a due topic) and lacks
  `commonplace-book-three.md` (two upcoming groups).

### Not verified

- Nothing in the window; this milestone has no UI.
- ts-fsrs's learning steps in a live session: a card graded again is due
  ten minutes later as an instant, and the queue treats an instant as due
  when it is ≤ `now`. That is exercised in the test, not in use.
- Time zones east of UTC+11 would shift the local day of the test `now`;
  the tests are pinned to noon UTC, which covers this machine.

### Decisions worth knowing

- Postpone does not count as a pass (`reps` unchanged) for reading or
  writing; the prototype bumped it. FORMAT.md defines reps as passes made.
- A single-group cloze grades its `sr c1` line if the file has one, else the
  bare line. A multi-group cloze always writes group lines; the bare line is
  read as a fallback and left alone.
- Card items carry `pri` 2 when due and 3 otherwise, copied from the
  prototype so due cards and due topics interleave at the same rank.
- `reading.*` / `writing.*` namespaces exist because both loops have
  `postpone`.

## 2026-09-16 — milestone 2: vault layer

Commit `3d32a17` — *vault: open, walk, read, write, watch over an Fs interface*.

### Done

- `src/vault/`: `Fs` interface (`fs.ts`), tree walker (`walk.ts`), `Vault`
  (`vault.ts`) with `open`, `read`, `update`, `write`, `changed`, `watch`,
  `subscribe`, `loadState`, `saveState`. Pure; no Tauri import.
- Adapters: `node-fs.ts` (node:fs, tests) and `tauri-fs.ts`
  (`@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`, app).
- Conflict rule: `update(path, mutate)` re-reads and re-applies when the
  file's mtime or size moved since it was read. Atomic writes via
  `name.md.ilmi-tmp` + rename. Our own write is recorded with its new stamp,
  so the watcher's echo of it is ignored.
- App: `src/app/vault.ts` opens a vault (dialog, or `ILMI_VAULT` in dev),
  watches it, and publishes `vault` + `files` to the store. `App.tsx` shows an
  "Open vault" button, then a plain list of document paths. Component CSS
  starts in `src/app/app.css`.
- Tauri: `allow_vault` and `initial_vault` commands in `lib.rs`; fs plugin
  `watch` feature; `fs:allow-*` permissions and `log:default` in the
  capability; `plugins.fs.requireLiteralLeadingDot: false` in
  `tauri.conf.json`. `@tauri-apps/plugin-log` added for dev logging.
- 16 tests in `src/vault/__tests__/vault.test.ts` over a temp copy of the
  corpus vault: tree shape, dot-dir and non-md skipping, diagnostics kept,
  one-line diff for a schedule change, atomic write, concurrent edit keeps
  both sides, whole-doc overwrite refused on conflict, own write not mistaken
  for external, external change re-read and reported, appear/disappear
  re-walks, real `fs.watch` delivery, state.json defaults and round-trip.

### Verified

- `npm test` green (95 tests), `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build` ok.
- `ILMI_VAULT=<corpus vault> npm run tauri dev` opened the window and the
  renderer logged all 11 document paths of the sample vault through the log
  plugin, so `readDir`/`stat`/`watch` went through plugin-fs with the
  widened scope. The vault watcher test was run five times without a flake.

### Not verified

- The window itself was not seen (no screenshot path in this sandbox); the
  list is verified by the log line, the CSS by reading.
- Watch events arriving from plugin-fs into `vault.changed` in the window.
  The Node path is tested; the Tauri `watch` command registered and returned.
- The "Open vault" dialog path was not clicked. It uses the same `openVault`
  as the env-var path, plus the dialog's own scope grant.

### Gotchas for later

- `tauri-plugin-fs` needs `features = ["watch"]` or the `watch` command does
  not exist ("Command watch not found" in the webview console).
- The dialog's scope grant is `vault/**`, and on unix that glob skips
  dot-paths unless `requireLiteralLeadingDot` is false in the plugin config
  (not the capability).
- React StrictMode runs the open effect twice in dev; `openVault` closes the
  previous vault first, so it is harmless but shows as two log lines.
- `ILMI_VAULT` is read only in debug builds (`cfg!(debug_assertions)`).

## 2026-09-16 — milestone 1: app scaffold

Commit `0c47994` — *scaffold: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tauri, tokens, three themes*.

### Done

- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript app, rooted at the repo. `index.html` loads
  `src/app/main.tsx`. `src/format/` untouched.
- `src/app/store.ts`: Zustand store with `theme` and `density`. Console
  toggle until the tweaks panel exists: `ilmi.theme('dark')`,
  `ilmi.cycleTheme()`, `ilmi.density(0.8)`.
- `src/app/tokens.css`: paper / ink / gold as CSS custom properties, three
  themes on `data-theme` (`light` / `dark` / `eink`), `--radius: 2px`, no
  shadows, e-ink strips shadows and transitions globally. Consolidated from
  the prototype's `styles.css` base rules plus its trailing flattening block.
  No component rules.
- Fonts bundled via `@fontsource` (IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono, Source
  Serif 4 variable, Literata variable). No CDN.
- Tauri v2 shell in `src-tauri/`, crate `ilmi`, plugins `fs` and `dialog`
  registered in `lib.rs` and granted in `capabilities/default.json`.
- `README.md` run section. `package.json` scripts: `dev`, `build`, `tauri`,
  `test`, `typecheck`.
- `src/app/__tests__/store.test.ts` covers the theme cycle.

### Verified

- `npm run tauri dev` opened the window on this machine after the first
  Rust compile (about 35 s).
- `npm test` green (79 tests), `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build`
  produces `dist/`.

### Not verified

- The console theme toggle was not exercised inside the window. Screen
  capture is blocked in the tool sandbox and the Chrome extension did not
  respond. Covered by the store test and the CSS rules only. Run
  `npm run tauri dev`, open devtools, and try `ilmi.theme('dark')` once.

### Environment changes

- Rust 1.98 installed with rustup, minimal profile, `--no-modify-path`.
  Cargo lives in `~/.cargo/bin` and is not on the login `PATH`.

### Gotchas for later

- Vite 8 ships without esbuild; keep `build.minify` a boolean.
- `vite.config.ts` doubles as the vitest config, so import `defineConfig`
  from `vitest/config`.
- `fs:default` only reads inside app-private dirs. Milestone 2 needs
  `fs:allow-read-dir` and friends scoped to the picked vault, or an
  `fs:scope` entry in the capability.

### Handoff prompt
